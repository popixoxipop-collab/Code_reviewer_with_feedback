"""Rate-aware rotation across multiple NVIDIA Build API keys.

NVIDIA Build's free tier caps each API key at 40 requests/minute *per model*
(https://build.nvidia.com). Pooling N independently-issued keys and routing
each call to whichever key currently has the most headroom raises the
practical ceiling to N x 40 RPM per model without exceeding any single key's
limit for that model.

This module only tracks and enforces the sliding-window budget; it does not
make HTTP calls itself (see nvidia_client.py for the calling wrapper).

Vendored verbatim from github.com/popixoxipop-collab/nvidia-build (src/nvidia_key_pool.py).
See D56 in generate_questions.py / README.md for why this is a copy, not a package
dependency. If you change rotation/retry behavior, update the source repo first,
then re-copy here. (Last synced: nvidia-build commit 6b57963, D11 per-model fix.)

    # D11: budget tracked per model, not one shared bucket for the whole key

    #        A single shared bucket meant that driving many *different*
    #        models through one key (e.g. benchmarking 87 models with 1 key)
    #        made the pool think the key was saturated after only 40 calls
    #        total, even though each individual model was nowhere near its
    #        own real 40/min ceiling. Discovered when a live survey against
    #        87 models logged "All 1 keys saturated" / HTTP 429 for slow
    #        models whose calls piled up behind faster ones sharing the same
    #        bucket -- not a real server-side limit, a client-side undercount.
    #   COST: memory grows with the number of distinct models seen (each gets
    #         its own deque); irrelevant in practice (a handful of model IDs).

    #         of per-(key,model), collapse this back to a single deque.
