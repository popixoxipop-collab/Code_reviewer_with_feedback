/**
 * D-C (PLAN.md): integrate.api.nvidia.com has no Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
 * (verified 2026-07-14), so browser calls from docs/lab/ must go through a proxy.
 * This is that proxy -- deployable by anyone on the team as their own Cloudflare
 * Worker, then pasted into the tool's "LLM 프록시 URL" field. The whole point of
 * publishing this file in the repo is that anyone can read exactly what it does with
 * the API key they paste into it.
 *
 * Deploy: `cd worker && wrangler deploy` (needs `wrangler.toml`'s kv_namespaces/queues
 * bindings, which need a KV namespace + Queue created once per account -- see
 * experiments/web_lab/SETUP.md). Needs a free Cloudflare account + `wrangler login`.
 *
 * D-H (2026-07-14, README D143): async job-queue redesign, replacing D-E's streaming
 * attempt. Cloudflare's free-tier edge gives up after ~100-125s of silence on a single
 * request -- and NVIDIA build-tier models normally take up to several minutes under load
 * (feedback/nvidia_client.py's DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S=600, with D98's own history of "up to
 * ~300s+ under load" -- confirmed live this session: qwen3-next-80b took 92s on one call
 * and didn't respond at all within 150s on another). Streaming (D-E) only helps once
 * NVIDIA starts sending bytes; it can't help if NVIDIA is slow to send the FIRST byte,
 * which is exactly what kept happening. No client-facing HTTP request can survive that
 * wait, streamed or not -- so this doesn't try to keep one alive. POST submits a job and
 * returns a job_id almost instantly; the actual NVIDIA call happens in queue() below,
 * a Cloudflare Queue consumer invocation, which gets up to 15 minutes wall-clock with no
 * penalty for I/O wait (Cloudflare's documented queue consumer limit -- verified against
 * https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/platform/limits/). GET polls for the result.
 *
 * D-D (PLAN.md) still mostly holds but has one real change worth being explicit about:
 * the API key is no longer used-and-discarded within a single request/response. It now
 * travels inside the queued job message (Cloudflare Queues retains messages up to 24h)
 * so the consumer invocation can use it once NVIDIA is ready to be called. It is still
 * never written to KV (only job status/result is), never logged, never returned in any
 * response. The trust boundary is "whoever controls this Cloudflare account" either way --
 * the Worker code already had the raw key in memory before this change too -- but it's no
 * longer strictly "in memory for the duration of one HTTP request and then gone", so this
 * is recorded here rather than left as an unstated regression from D-D's original claim.
 *
 * D-I (2026-07-14): retry-with-backoff in queue(), replacing D-H's "always ack, never
 * retry" stance. D-H assumed a failure meant NVIDIA had genuinely rejected the request,
 * so retrying would "just repeat the same slow/failed call." That assumption was tested
 * and falsified this session: a direct curl to the same endpoint, bypassing every piece
 * of this project's own infrastructure (no Worker, no Queue), got a clean 200 after
 * 236.7s on a heavy prompt -- well past the ~100-125s mark that both D-H and a since-
 * observed queue-consumer 524 looked like a hard ceiling. The failures aren't a
 * deterministic timeout; they're intermittent NVIDIA-side flakiness (same conclusion as
 * README's D142, now with more data) -- the same kind of request can fail once and
 * succeed on a later attempt. So each attempt now gets its own AbortController timeout
 * (600s, matching feedback/nvidia_client.py's DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S so this isn't a new
 * made-up number), and a retryable failure (timeout, network error, or NVIDIA returning
 * 429/500/502/503/524) calls message.retry() instead of message.ack(). This relies on
 * Cloudflare's own queue redelivery (verified against
 * https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/): retry()
 * redelivers the message as a brand-new consumer invocation, which gets its own fresh
 * 15-minute wall-clock budget rather than looping inside this one, so retrying doesn't
 * eat into the same invocation's time. message.attempts (also part of that API,
 * 1-indexed) caps this at MAX_ATTEMPTS total before giving up and writing a terminal
 * "error" record; a non-retryable status (e.g. 400/401 -- a real client error, not
 * flakiness) still fails immediately, since retrying a malformed request or bad key
 * would just waste attempts.
 *   WHY: observed failures aren't deterministic -- a second attempt has a real chance
 *     of succeeding, confirmed live (see above).
 *   COST: a job that keeps hitting retryable failures can now take up to MAX_ATTEMPTS *
 *     ~600s (worst case ~30 min) before the client sees a terminal error, instead of
 *     failing after one bad response in a few seconds. JOB_TTL_SECONDS (1h) already
 *     covers this window.
 *   EXIT: if NVIDIA's flakiness turns out to correlate with something identifiable (time
 *     of day, a specific NVIDIA_API_KEY_N, request size), replace the blind retry with a
 *     targeted fix once that pattern is confirmed with data -- don't keep raising
 *     MAX_ATTEMPTS as a substitute for finding the actual pattern.

// reached attempt 3/3 and failed terminally, before settling). A stale/duplicate delivery

// delivery already wrote the real terminal done/error record, un-terminating a job the
// client may already be about to see resolved -- or worse, a stale delivery's terminal
// write could clobber a genuine "done" with a stale "error" (or vice versa) if timing
// goes the other way. Every write in queue() now goes through this: once a job is
