// HTTP request open. D-E's streaming attempt only helped once NVIDIA started sending
// bytes -- it couldn't help when NVIDIA was slow to send the FIRST byte, which turned out
// to be the actual failure mode (confirmed live: qwen3-next-80b took 92s on one call and
// didn't answer at all within 150s on another -- normal variance for this tier per
// feedback/nvidia_client.py's own 600s timeout and D98 history, not an outage). No
// client-facing request can survive that wait, streamed or not. So this doesn't try to --
// worker/nvidia-proxy.js now answers the POST almost instantly with a job_id and does the
// real call in a Cloudflare Queue consumer (up to 15 minutes, no client watching), and
// this file polls GET ?job=<id> until it's done. callPromptStage()/generateQuestion() etc.

// place that knows the transport is submit-and-poll now, same as it was the only place

// budget) instead of failing after one bad response -- see that file for why. MAX_POLL_MS

  //   WHY: step-3.7-flash (the default model as of D215, since step-3.5-flash is being

  //   the rest.

  // before it can ask a grounded question has nowhere to put that request. This is the
